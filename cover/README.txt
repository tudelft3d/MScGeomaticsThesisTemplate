Notice that I would *not* include it for the online version you put on the TU Delft repository (same for the back cover), and use it only for the printed version.

The cover (front + back) must be manually updated with your details and own figure. To do so, you must either:
  - edit the PDF directly in Illustrator;
  - use the PSD files in Illustrator, edit them and export to PDF; (I haven't tested them, just exported from another software)
  - use the afdesign file if you have a Mac and the software Affinity Designer (https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/); great but not free.

If your figure has lighter colours, use the black logo of TU Delft provided.

The font of the title is the same as the title font of the document: CMU Sans Serif (Computer Modern), which is freely available there: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern

The official TUDelft template now recommends Roboto as font for titles, so if you want to be 100% TUDelft approved use this. There are no strict rules for cover pages.

Also, the blue used as the background could be changed for one of the 'approved' colours by the TU Delft style police: https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/services/communication/manuals/tu-delft-corporate-design/colours/
